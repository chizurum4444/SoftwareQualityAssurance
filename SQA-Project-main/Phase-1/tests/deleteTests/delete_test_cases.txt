delete1 checks if the input username matches an existing user and is not the current user
delete2 checks that the deleted user cannot use any transactions (including loggin in)

Note for all tests to be successful, a pass is required for each tested element in a test. e.g. if test0 checks a, b and c, then each of a, b and c 
must pass for test0 to be considered a pass

Note all tests other than delete0 the tests assume that the user is logged in as admin
