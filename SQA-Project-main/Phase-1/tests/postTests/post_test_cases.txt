post0 user is not rent standard
post1 information is valid (conforms to maximum constraints, rental flag set to false, etc)
post2 information is correctly written to the daily transaction

Note for all tests to be successful, a pass is required for each tested element in a test. e.g. if test0 checks a, b and c, then each of a, b and c 
must pass for test0 to be considered a pass

Note that the test post1 will assume that the current user's type is post standard
